# Introduction

This repository contains the data used by the paper "Automated Repair of Code from Language Models".
The repisotory is split into multiple main folders with explanations given below:
* APR_Patches
* Defects_Classifications
* LMDefects

## LMDefects
The LMDefects folder contains the LMDefects the dataset, split into two main folders - Codex_Generated_Solutions and Codex_Generated_Solutions_Ground_Truth, 
the former having the originally generated solutions and the later fixed versions of the problems, assuming such a fix was found.

## APR_Patches
The APR_Patches folder contsins the fault localization information, used by both Recorder and TBar, the patches generated by the aforementioned tools and the patches
generated by the three versions of Codex-e we have used.

## Defects_Classifications
The Defects_Classifications sheet contains the data of our classifications of the different solutions, whether they could compile or not, 
whether the solution is plausible and the type of fix needed.
