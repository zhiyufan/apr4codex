/*
 * You are given an array of n elements. Now we are going to choose some elements from the array and put them into a new array.
 * We want to make the new array as large as possible. So, our definition of large is:
 * if we give each element a value of 1 and each non-chosen element a value of -1, we want the sum of the new array to be as large as possible.
 * To be clear, elements can be either part of the new array or not, but we canâ€™t pick half of an element and put it into the new array.
 * You are given the array, the number of elements in the new array k, and the maximum value of any element in the array m.
 * You are required to find the order you should choose the elements from the array. That is, if you choose elements in the order a1, a2, ..., ak,
 * then the new array should be as large as possible. If there are multiple such orders, then choose the one that contains the first element,
 * then the second element and so on.
 *
 * Input:
 * First line is T, the number of the test cases. (1 <= T <= 100)
 * For each test case, there are three numbers n, k and m, followed by n numbers ai, (1 <= n <= 100,000, 1 <= k <= n, 1 <= m <= 1,000,000,000,
 * |ai| <= m), representing the array.
 *
 * Output:
 * T lines, each line contains a permutation of the integers from 1 to n.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input:
 * 1
 * 5 2 5
 * -2 3 2 -4 4
 *
 * Output:
 * 1 2
 *
 * Explanation:
 * The largest array we can have is a1, a4, with a sum of 1 + 4 = 5
